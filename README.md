# Demon Hunter
## RPG (Role-playing game) website made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
### By NACK2

- Explored UX/UI design by creating user functionality to buy items, unlock weapons, check inventory, roam the wilderness, collide with monsters, pick from an array of different attacks and more
- Used LocalStorage API to store and load user data, therefore user progress will stay intact even after the browser is closed
